# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy LakeBrownie to Databricks Apps.

## Prerequisites

- Databricks CLI installed and configured
- Access to a Databricks workspace with Apps enabled
- PostgreSQL-compatible database (Lakebase recommended)

## 1. Database Setup

### 1.1 Create Database Instance

Prepare a Databricks Lakebase or external PostgreSQL instance.

- **Databricks Lakebase (recommended):** Create a Lakebase instance from the Databricks console
- **External PostgreSQL:** Ensure it is accessible from Databricks Apps via network configuration

> **Note:** This application has been tested with [Neon](https://neon.tech/) as an external PostgreSQL provider.

### 1.2 Create Application User

Create a dedicated database user for the application.

```sql
-- Create application user with RLS bypass explicitly disabled
CREATE ROLE lakebrownie_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your-secure-password' NOBYPASSRLS;

-- Grant role privileges to current user (required for database creation)
GRANT lakebrownie_user TO CURRENT_USER WITH SET TRUE;
```

**Important:** The application uses Row-Level Security (RLS) with `current_setting('app.user_id', true)`. The application sets this session variable for each request to enforce user isolation. The `NOBYPASSRLS` option ensures the application user cannot bypass RLS policies, providing an additional layer of security.

### 1.3 Create Database

Create the application database and set the owner.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lakebrownie OWNER lakebrownie_user;
```

### 1.4 Database Migrations

Database migrations are automatically applied when the server starts. No manual migration steps are required for deployment.

Automatic migrations are disabled in the following cases:
- When environment variable `DISABLE_AUTO_MIGRATION=true` is set
- When environment variable `NODE_ENV=test` is set

**For local development or manual migration:**

```bash
# Set database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://lakebrownie_user:password@host:5432/lakebrownie"

# Navigate to api directory
cd apps/api

# Generate migration files (if schema changed)
npm run db:generate

# Manually apply migrations (optional)
npm run db:migrate
```

## 2. Configure Secrets

Create a Databricks secret scope and add required secrets.

### 2.1 Create Secret Scope

```bash
# Development
databricks secrets create-scope lakebrownie-dev

# Production
databricks secrets create-scope lakebrownie-prod
```

### 2.2 Add Required Secrets

**Database URL:**

```bash
databricks secrets put-secret lakebrownie-[dev|prod] database-url --string-value "postgresql://lakebrownie_user:password@host:5432/lakebrownie"
```

**Encryption Key:**

Generate a secure encryption key for encrypting sensitive data (OAuth tokens, etc.). A 32-byte key (64 hexadecimal characters) is required.

```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
databricks secrets put-secret lakebrownie-[dev|prod] encryption-key --string-value "$ENCRYPTION_KEY"
```

## 3. Deploy with Asset Bundles

> **Note:** This deployment method using Databricks Asset Bundles is a temporary solution until Lakebase support is available in the bundle configuration. Once Lakebase integration is supported, the database and user creation steps may be automated through bundle resources, enabling full infrastructure-as-code deployment including the database.

> **Default Target:** The `databricks.yaml` is configured to use `dev` as the default target. You can omit `--target` for development deployments.

### 3.1 Validate Bundle Configuration

```bash
databricks bundle validate [--target prod]
```

### 3.2 Deploy to Databricks

```bash
databricks bundle deploy [--target prod]
```

### 3.3 Start Application

```bash
databricks bundle run lakebrownie_app [--target prod]
```

### 3.4 Verify Deployment

After deployment, check the application status:

```bash
# List deployed apps
databricks apps list

# Get app details
databricks apps get lakebrownie-dev-<user-id>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

1. Verify the database URL in secrets is correct
2. Check network connectivity between Databricks Apps and the database
3. Ensure the database user has appropriate permissions

### Migration Failures

1. Ensure the database user has owner privileges
2. Check for existing objects that might conflict
3. Review the migration SQL files for errors

### Application Startup Issues

1. Check application logs in Databricks Apps console
2. Verify all required secrets are configured
3. Ensure the build completed successfully before deployment

## Environment-Specific Configuration

| Setting | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Bundle Target | `dev` | `prod` |
| Secret Scope | `lakebrownie-dev` | `lakebrownie-prod` |
| App Name | `lakebrownie-dev-<user-id>` | `lakebrownie-prod` |
| Workspace Path | `/Workspace/Users/<user>/.bundle/...` | `/Workspace/Shared/.bundle/...` |

## Security Considerations

1. **Database credentials:** Always use dedicated application users, not admin accounts
2. **Encryption keys:** Generate unique keys for each environment
3. **Secret scopes:** Restrict access to secret scopes appropriately
4. **Network security:** Configure private endpoints where possible
