## Overview

LakeScout is a Claude Code-like AI chat application running on Databricks Apps. Users can ask Claude to create code and perform Databricks workspace operations using natural language.

## File System and User Environment

### User Environment Isolation

In LakeScout, each user is assigned a dedicated file system area. This ensures data isolation between users.

```
${LAKESCOUT_BASE_DIR}/
├── users/
│   ├── user1/                          # User 1's home directory
│   │   ├── .claude/
│   │   │   ├── settings.local.json     # Claude settings
│   │   │   └── skills/                 # User's skills
│   │   │       ├── my-skill/
│   │   │       │   └── SKILL.md
│   │   │       └── another-skill/
│   │   │           └── SKILL.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── user2/                          # User 2's home directory
│       └── ...
├── sessions/
│   ├── session_xxx.../                 # Session working directory
│   └── session_yyy.../
└── db/
    └── lakescout.sqlite                # SQLite database (dev fallback)
```

### Directory Roles

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `${LAKESCOUT_BASE_DIR}/users/${userId}` | User's home directory. User settings and skills are stored here |
| `${userHome}/.claude/` | Claude-related configuration files |
| `${userHome}/.claude/skills/` | Skills created or imported by the user |
| `${LAKESCOUT_BASE_DIR}/sessions/${sessionId}` | Working directory for each session |
| `${LAKESCOUT_BASE_DIR}/db/` | SQLite database directory (development) |

### Skills and File System

Skills are stored on the file system, which provides the following characteristics:

- **Persistence**: Skills are retained after session ends
- **User-specific**: Each user has their own set of skills
- **Portability**: Skills can be imported from Git repositories

## Authentication and Permissions

LakeScout uses different authentication methods depending on the type of operation.

### Authentication by Operation Type

| Category | Token Used | PAT Registration | Description |
|----------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Claude Code Model** | PAT → SP | Recommended | Databricks-hosted Foundation Model API |
| **CLI in Hooks** | PAT → SP | Recommended | `workspace export-dir` in SessionStart hooks |
| **Databricks CLI (Claude execution)** | PAT → SP | Recommended | CLI commands like `databricks sync` |
| **Databricks Apps Operations (MCP)** | PAT → SP | Recommended | Create/deploy apps, get logs |
| **Databricks SQL (MCP)** | OBO | Not required | Execute SQL with user permissions |

※ "PAT → SP" means PAT is used if registered, otherwise falls back to Service Principal

### Authentication Method Details

#### OBO (On-Behalf-Of) Token

A token automatically provided by the Databricks Apps authentication proxy. **No user action required** - it's available just by accessing the app.

- **Use case**: Databricks SQL execution via MCP
- **Permissions**: User's own Databricks permissions

#### PAT (Personal Access Token)

A token that users generate in Databricks and register with the app.

- **Use case**: CLI commands executed by Claude, Apps operations
- **Permissions**: User's own Databricks permissions
- **How to register**:
  1. Generate in Databricks UI → Settings → Developer → Access tokens
  2. Register the token in LakeScout's settings screen

**Note**: PAT must start with `dapi`.

#### Service Principal (SP)

A service account token configured in the application. Automatically used when PAT is not registered.

- **Use case**: Fallback for PAT
- **Permissions**: Limited to permissions granted to the SP

### Why PAT Registration is Required

Ideally, all operations would use OBO tokens, but the current OBO token lacks the following authorization scopes, requiring PAT:

- **Workspace operations**: File read/write and sync
- **Model Serving Endpoint**: Claude Code's foundation model calls

Registering a PAT provides the following benefits:

1. **User permission execution**: Claude can operate all resources you have access to
2. **Audit logging**: Operations are recorded under your user name
3. **Bypass SP limitations**: Use permissions not granted to the SP

Without a PAT registered, operations are limited to the SP's permission scope.

## Skills System

### What are Skills?

Skills are custom instruction sets that extend Claude's capabilities. They are written in SKILL.md files and referenced by Claude when executing tasks.

### Skill Structure

```yaml
---
name: my-custom-skill
description: Description of this skill
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  author: your-name
  source: https://github.com/org/repo  # For Git imports
---

# Skill Content

Write instructions for Claude in Markdown format here.
```

### Skill Storage Location

Skills are stored in the user's file system area:

```
${userHome}/.claude/skills/
├── skill-name-1/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── skill-name-2/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Skill Management

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| List | View registered skills |
| Create | Create new skill |
| Edit | Update existing skill content |
| Delete | Remove unwanted skills |
| Git Import | Import skills from public repositories |

### Import from Git

Skills can be imported from public Git repositories:

- **Supported formats**: HTTPS URL or SSH URL
- **Branch specification**: Can import from specific branch
- **Path specification**: Can specify specific directory within repository

### Backup/Restore to Workspace

You can backup skills to Databricks Workspace and restore them later. This enables skill persistence and sharing across devices.

#### Backup Destination

Skills are backed up to the following path:

```
/Workspace/Users/{username}/.assistant/skills/
```

#### How to Use

1. **Backup**: Select "Backup" from the split button on the skills management screen, then click "Start Backup" in the confirmation dialog
2. **Restore**: Select "Restore" from the split button dropdown, then click "Start Restore" in the confirmation dialog

#### Important Notes

- **PAT Required**: Backup/restore operations require PAT registration
- **Overwrite Behavior**: Backup overwrites existing Workspace skills; restore overwrites existing local skills completely
- **Entire Directory**: The entire skills directory is synced, not individual skills

## Sessions and Workspace Integration

### How Sessions Work

Each chat session is assigned a dedicated working directory:

```
${userHome}/${sessionId}/
├── .claude/
│   └── settings.local.json  # SessionStart hook settings
├── imported_file1.py        # Files imported from Workspace
└── imported_file2.sql
```

### SessionStart Hooks

Commands that automatically execute at session start can be configured. When specifying Databricks Workspace as a source, the following command is automatically set:

```bash
databricks workspace export-dir "/Workspace/path/to/source" . --overwrite
```

This downloads Workspace files locally when the session starts.

### Workspace Operations Policy

In LakeScout, we adopt the policy of **having Claude Code perform** Workspace and app operations:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Workspace Operation Flow                                      │
│                                                                │
│  User: "Fix this code and save it to Workspace"               │
│      ↓                                                         │
│  Claude: Edits the file                                        │
│      ↓                                                         │
│  Claude: Syncs to Workspace with databricks sync               │
│      ↓                                                         │
│  Claude: Reports "Done"                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Flexibility**: Claude selects optimal commands based on the situation
2. **Transparency**: Commands executed are shown to the user
3. **Error Handling**: Claude interprets and handles errors
4. **Learning**: Users can learn CLI usage

#### Main Databricks CLI Commands

Main CLI commands used by Claude within sessions:

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `databricks workspace export-dir` | Download files from Workspace |
| `databricks workspace import-dir` | Upload files to Workspace |
| `databricks sync` | Sync local and Workspace |
| `databricks fs` | Unity Catalog Volumes operations |
| `databricks clusters` | Cluster management |
| `databricks jobs` | Job management |

## Security

### Data Isolation

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)

The database uses PostgreSQL RLS to restrict users to accessing only their own data:

- **Sessions**: Can only view own sessions
- **Tokens**: Can only manage own tokens
- **Settings**: Can only modify own settings

#### File System Isolation

- Each user's files are isolated under `${LAKESCOUT_BASE_DIR}/users/${userId}`
- Validation implemented to prevent path traversal attacks
- Session deletion only removes the corresponding directory

### Token Protection

#### Encryption

Sensitive tokens like PAT are encrypted with AES-256-GCM:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key length**: 256 bits (64 hexadecimal characters)
- **IV**: Randomly generated for each encryption

#### Display Masking

When displaying tokens in the UI, they are partially masked:

```
dapi****xyz  (only first 4 + last 3 characters shown)
```

### Input Validation

#### Skill Names

- Allowed characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`
- Path separators (`/`, `\`) are prohibited
- `.` and `..` are prohibited

#### Git URLs

- Only URLs starting with `https://` or `git@` are allowed
- Branch name validation

### Session Security

- Session IDs are in TypeID format (UUIDv7-based)
- Independent working directory per session
- Cannot access other users' sessions
